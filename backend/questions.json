        "answer": "2x", 
        "topic": "derivatives",
        "explanation": "The derivative of x^2 is 2x because the power rule states d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1), so for x^2, itâ€™s 2*x^(2-1) = 2x."

        "topic": "integrals",
        "explanation": "The integral of 2x dx is x^2 + C because the reverse of the power rule gives x^2, and we add +C for the constant of integration."
